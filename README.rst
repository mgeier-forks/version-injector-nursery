Version Injector
================

Alternatives:

Re-build:

https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/multiversion

https://sphinx-contrib.github.io/multiversion

All versions have to be re-built each time something changes.

Another variation: https://github.com/devanshshukla99/sphinx-versioned-docs

Their now apparently unmaintained predecessors seem to be:

https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinxcontrib-versioning

https://github.com/Smile-SA/sphinx-versions

Fetch with JavaScript:

https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/flyout-menu.html

https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html

https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/version-dropdown.html

Inject into previously built HTML files:

https://github.com/steinwurf/versjon

Injects text in existing HTML files

Non-Sphinx projects with versioning:

https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning

https://github.com/jimporter/mike (for MkDocs)
